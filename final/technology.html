            <h2>Technology</h2>
            
            <p>Formula 1 has always rewarded good car development and it is vital to winning a championship. As a result, many technologies have 
                    been implemented over the years to make the cars faster and safer as well. This page outlines the more important features on a 
                    Formula 1 car that the average person needs to know about to start enjoying the sport.</p>
            
            <h3>Engine Placement</h3>
            <div class="twocolumn">
                <p>One early example of engineering that is still relevant in the world of F1 can be traced back to 1957, where British constructor 
                    Cooper would relocate the engine from being in front of the driver like on a regular street car to behind, where the car would be at 
                    a more even weight distribution and would be easier to control. The back to back championships of Jack Brabham under Cooper in '59 
                    and '60 would mark the change as an improvement. This would also mean that rest of the manufacturers would also implement this. To 
                    this day, F1 cars mount the engine behind the driver.
                </p>

            <h3>Kinetic Energy Recovery System</h3>
            <div class="twocolumn">
                <p>In 2009, the KERS or Kinetic Energy Recovery System was introduced which allowed a battery to harvest energy created under braking 
                    which was then stored to be used while accelerating. As of 2019, cars use an upgraded version of KERS known as ERS. The addition of 
                    this technology as well as the 2014 addition of 1.6-litre turbocharged V6 hybrid engines means that F1 cars are now much more 
                    reliant on electrical components then ever before and has led to the current era of Formula 1 coming to be known as the 'Hybrid 
                    Era'.

            <h3>Steering Wheel</h3>
            <div class="twocolumn">
                <p>Speaking of electronics and tech, there is probably not a more cool piece of tech on the car than the steering wheel, which is decked 
                    out with loads of buttons, switches, rotaries, and paddles to perform a wide variety of tasks from switching engine modes to setting 
                    the pit stop speed limit to dispensing water to the driver. It is interesting to note that a steering wheel for the 2019 season cost 
                    around $60,000, which is much more than the average cost for a new consumer car.

            <h3>Semi-automatic Gears</h3>
            <div class="twocolumn">
                <p>The 1989 season saw the debut of semi automatic gears, which meant that drivers no longer had to worry about using the clutch and 
                    stick shift when shifting gears. This lead to use of paddles mounted behind the steering wheel to shift gears. This makes for faster 
                    racing because it allows the driver to always keep two hands on the steering wheel and shift quicker with their fingers.
                </p>

            <h3>Tires</h3>
            <div class="twocolumn">
                <p>For the 2019 season, there were three different sets of tire compounds. The tires used are made by Pirelli and are slick tires, 
                    meaning they have no grooves and are designed to grip the road better. The tires are also designed to have short lifespans, so that 
                    pitstops are required and so that they present challenges to the drivers and teams as they degrade throughout a race. The tire 
                    compounds are hard(white), medium(yellow), and soft(red). The softer the tire the better grip it provides to the road but this also 
                    means that it degrades quicker. It is just the opposite for the harder tires, which provide less grip to the road but have a longer 
                    life.
                </p>

            <h3>Drag Reduction System</h3>
            <div class="twocolumn">
                <p>The Drag Reduction System (DRS) was introduced in 2011 and works by allowing the driver to open a gap in the rear wing of the car. 
                    This means that there is less drag, allowing the car to go faster and can make the difference when overtaking another car. The use 
                    of DRS is prohibited unless the driver is in certain situations, such as in a DRS zone and 1 second behind the car in front.

            <h3>The Halo Safety Device</h3>
            <div class="twocolumn">
                <p>The 2018 season saw the introduction of the Halo, which is a curved titanium bar placed over the driver and is designed to deflect 
                    possible shrapnel and other flying hazards that could possibly cause injuries. It is purely a safety feature and does not add to the 
                    performance of the cars. It is not the nicest looking addition and was met with resistance from fans and even drivers but the halo 
                    is a reminder that the sport will continue to evolve its safety mechanisms as faster speeds are achieved. As of 2019, Formula 1 cars 
                    routinely reach speeds of 322kmh or 200 mph.
