            <h2>Rules - A Basic Introduction</h2>
            <p>Formula 1 can get very technical but the aim of this page is to explain the general rules in a casual manner so that anyone can get to 
                watching and enjoying a Formula 1 race weekend. First, it covers some general <a href="#regulations">regulations</a> viewers should know 
                about. It then covers the <a href="#eventformat">format</a> for a Formula 1 race weekend and goes over each individual section including the

            <h3>Two cars per team</h3>
            <div class="twocolumn">
                <p>There are 10 teams in the 2019 season. Each team is mandated to have two car entries and two drivers as well as reserve/test 
                    drivers. The two car per team system allows teams to spread their odds out in a race and also encourages improvement from the 
                    drivers as they are compared to each other and allows the team to see if a driver is not performing up to a standard.
                </p>

            <h3>Parts Limit</h3>
            <p>Each car has a limited amount of parts that it can use throughout the season. These include limits on three internal combustion 
                engines, MGU-H and turbochargers, and two MGU-K, control electronics and batteries over the course of a season. Gearboxes must be used 
                for 5 consecutive events.</p>
            
            <h3>Unscheduled parts change</h3>
            <p>Any unscheduled change of a part during the weekend, such as a gearbox change, result in penalties usually in the form of a grid 
                position penalty.</p>
            
            
            <!--EVENT FORMAT-->
            
            <h2 id="eventformat">Event Format</h2>

            <p>There are 21 rounds in the current 2019 Formula 1 season. A 'round' is really just a weekend-long event held on a race 
                track at a particular location and is appended with the words 'Grand Prix'. For example, the British Grand Prix is held in 
                Silverstone Circuit in Silverstone, UK.
            </p>

            </figure>
            
            
            <p>The entire weekend event is made up of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>3 Practice Sessions held on Friday and Saturday</li>
                <li>A Qualifying Session held on Saturday which determines the starting grid or positions for the race</li>
                <li>The race itself which is held on Sunday.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The only race weekend which deviates from this norm is the Monaco Grand Prix, which schedules the first 2 practice sessions to Thursday 
                instead of Friday.
            </p>
            
            
            <!--PRACTICE SESSIONS-->
            
            <h2 id="practice">Friday and Saturday - The Practice Sessions</h2>
            <p>The 3 practice sessions serve as opportunities for the teams and drivers to test their cars before the qualifying session and the 
                race. The practice sessions are known as FP1, FP2, and FP3 and follow the schedule below:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>FP1 takes place on Friday morning and lasts for 90 minutes.</li>
                <li>FP2 takes place on Friday afternoon and also lasts for 90 minutes.</li>
                <li>FP3 takes place on Saturday, just before the qualifying session, and lasts for 60 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Practice sessions are very valuable because teams and drivers are restricted on where and when they can 
                test their cars. The majority of the time, drivers practice their driving skills on simulators and not on the actual cars 
                themselves. The practice sessions are the 'moment of truth' as to whether the car and driver will be competitive in the qualifying 
                session and race. This time is also where teams collect data, which they can send back to the factory where the cars can be 
                improved.
            </p>

            </figure>
            
            <p>This is also the time where drivers test different tire compounds. Tires are an important part of every race strategy and there are three 
                different compounds available to teams at the event:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Soft (red) - are the fastest tires but have the shortest lifespan. pitstops are more frequently required.</li>
                <li>Medium (yellow) - achieves speeds between the soft and hard and has a lifespan that is between the softs and hards.</li>
                <li>Hard (white) - are the slowest tires but have the longest lifespan. pitstops are less frequently required.</li>
            </ul>
                
            <p>Note that all competitor cars share the race track as they practice. This can sometimes lead to drivers impeding each and can lead to 
                penalties.
            </p>
            
        
            <!--QUALIFYING SESSIONS-->
            
            <h2 id="qualifying">Saturday - The Qualifying Session</h2>
            <p>The Qualifying Session is held on Saturday, after FP3. For the 2019 season, there were 20 drivers and thus 20 
                positions on the starting grid to fill out for the race start. The qualifying session is split into three phases:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Q1 - 18 minutes long, decides positions 16 - 20</li>
                <li>Q2 - 15 minutes long, decides positions 11 - 15</li>
                <li>Q3 - 12 minutes long, decides positions 1 - 10</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                With each phase, drivers try to finish a lap of the race track as fast as they can and have their time recorded. After the end of 
                each phase, the 5 slowest drivers have their final grid positions determined by their time (fastest cars go in front, slowest in the 
                back) and are done qualifying (and thus eliminated). Positions are commonly shortened to P and are followed by the number of the 
                position. For example, finishing third fastest means that you start P3 on the grid. By the time Q3 is reached, there are only 10 
                drivers left. This final phase is where positions 1 - 10 are determined and is where the fastest car is awarded P1 on the grid, 
                commonly known as pole position.
            </p>

            </figure>
              
            
            <p>Like the practice sessions, the race track is shared by all 20 drivers and can get hectic. After qualifying, cars are parked in Parc-
                Ferme, which is a safe and secure area where the cars are weighed and inspected by race officials. Teams are heavily restricted on what 
                they can do to their cars while they are in parc-ferme.
            </p>
            
            
            <!--RACE-->
            
            <h2 id="race">Sunday - The Race</h2>
            <h3>How the number of laps are determined</h3>
            <p>How many laps a race makes up is determined by figuring out the number of laps it takes to complete 305km. This means that for some 
                tracks, there are less laps and for other shorter circuits, there are more laps. For example, the shorter Monaco Grand Prix has 78 laps 
                and the longer British Grand Prix has 52 laps.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Pre-race Procedures</h3>
            
            <div class="twocolumn">
                <p>Prior to the race comes the Driver's Parade and other pre-race traditions and displays.

            <div class="twocolumn">
                <p>After all that is over, the teams bring their cars out of parc-ferme and position them on the grid position they achieved during 
                    qualifying. These are the last moments before the race and is where the last minute checkups are done.

            <h3>Pit Rules</h3>
             
            <p>The pit lane is where the teams and their personell are stationed at during the race and is the destination for the drivers to go to 
                when they need new tires, need something fixed on the car, or need to retire the car due to failures. A typical pit stop where only tires 
                are changed is very fast, lasting around 2 seconds
            </p>

            </figure>
            
            
            <p>General pit rules are as followed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The car must use at least 2 different tire compounds during the race, meaning that the car must be brought into the pits atleast 
                    once.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Refuelling has been banned since 2010, and no longer part of the race strategy.
                </li>
                <li>There is a pit lane speed limit that differs by race track. Penalites are given to those that speed in the pit lane.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Race control</h3>
            <div class="twocolumn">
                <p>Race Control is the group of people responsible for overseeing the practice sessions, qualifying session, and race. Their word is 
                    final on a lot of things. They keep constant communication with the teams, marshalls, safety car, and other officials to keep the 
                    race running smoothly. They are also responsible for handing out penalties to the teams and drivers.
                </p>

            <h3>Safety car</h3>
            <div class="twocolumn">
                <p>The safety car can be deployed onto the track to slow down the pace of the race cars if Race Control deems it neccessary. This is 
                    usually done after an accident or if track conditions become dangerous to drive fast on. The drivers are required to drive behind 
                    the safety car in a single file and are not allowed to overtake each other. It is kind of like the formation lap. When the track is 
                    safe to drive fast again, the safety car is recalled back to the pits and the drivers are allowed to race again. Safety cars often 
                    have a heavy impact on a race because it causes the cars to bunch up together again. There is also the Virtual Safety Car (VSC), 
                    which is used in situations where deploying the real safety car is not practical. The VSC requires all drivers to slow down to a 
                    certain speed limit wherever they may be on the track, meaning that drivers can get a 'free' pitstop in which they are not 
                    overtaken if they time it right.

            <h3>Race Marshalls</h3>
            <div class="twocolumn">
                <p>The race marshalls are the men and women in orange whom make sure the race goes smoothly by cleaning up track debris, assisting in 
                    crash cleanups, and using flags to notify racers of current track and racing conditions.

            <h3>Flags</h3>
            <div class="twocolumn">
                <p>Flags are used during the race, as well as the other parts of the weekend, to notify drivers of track conditions and also serve to 
                    give individual instructions to drivers. Common flags used throughout the race weekend include:

            <ul>
                <li>Yellow Flag - instructs drivers to slow down as there could be a stranded car or other hazard on the road. Overtaking is not allowed 
                    under yellow flags.
                </li>
                <li>Green Flag - shown to drivers that have driven past the hazard designated by a yellow flag. Instructs drivers to race as normal. 
                </li>
                <li>Red Flag - signals that the session is being halted, either because of really bad weather or a really bad accident. Drivers must 
                    return to the pits.
                </li>
                <li>Blue Flag - shown to drivers who are about to be lapped by a faster car. A driver shown blue flags must let the faster car pass with 
                    no resistance or defending.
                </li>
                <li>Black Flag - shown alongside a car number, indicates that the car has been disqualified from the session.
                </li>
                <li>Checkered Flag - waved during the last lap, signaling the end of the race.</li>

            <div class="twocolumn">
                 <p>Once the race is over, cars are driven back to parc-ferme, where they are weighed and inspected again. The drivers that finish 1st, 
                     2nd, and 3rd are said to have gotten a podium finish and get to take part in the podium ceremony, where they are awarded trophies 
                     and get to celebrate by spraying champagne at each other, as per tradition.

            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <p>There are actually two championships that are contested throughout the season, the World Drivers' Championship and 
                the World Constructors' Championship. Points are awarded to drivers that finish a race in the top ten. These points count towards their 
                standing in the Drivers' championship. A team's points is equal to the sum of their two drivers' points and count towards their standing 
                in the Constructors' championship.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>1st Place (P1) - 25 points</li>
                <li>2nd Place (P2) - 18 points</li>
                <li>3rd Place (P3) - 15 points</li>
                <li>4th Place (P4) - 12 points</li>
